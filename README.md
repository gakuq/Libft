# üìÅ `Libft`

A custom implementation of standard C library functions. Built from scratch in C as a foundational exercise in memory management, string manipulation, and pointer operations.

## Features
- Reimplementation of over 30 standard C library functions (`strlen`, `strcpy`, `memcpy`, etc.)
- Additional helper functions for string and list manipulation
- Custom `linked list` API (creation, deletion, iteration)

## Technologies
- C
- Makefile

## Usage
```bash
make
```
## Why
This project was built as part of the 42 curriculum to develop low-level understanding of how the C standard library works under the hood.
